This repository is made to register the code produced through Teacher Bruno classes from [Java Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx4x_zx8csUjFC5WWjoNUL7LOOD7LCKRW) in their YouTube channel [CFBCursos](https://www.youtube.com/c/cfbcursos).

These classes are introductory on Java programming and are so clear to understand.

The archives receive the class name and contain the code written in all classes. Sometimes I put in comments some explanation about them.
